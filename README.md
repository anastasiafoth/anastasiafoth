# Hi, I'm Anastasia 👋

I’m an **Aspiring Full-Stack Developer** with a background in **Fashion Design**, passionate about blending **creativity with technology**.

After **seven years in the fashion industry**, where I brought ideas from concept to production, I rediscovered my love for tech through **CLO 3D**—a tool that merges logical processes with creative precision. That experience reignited my fascination with software development.

Since **August**, I’ve been learning **Python** at **Masterschool**, progressing from the basics to more advanced topics like coding standards and exception handling. My long-term goal is to become a **Full-Stack Web Developer**, combining structured logic, visual thinking, and problem-solving skills.
