##Hi, I'm Anastasia 👋

Aspiring Full-Stack Developer with a background in Fashion Design and a passion for blending creativity with technology.

After seven years in the fashion industry—where I took ideas from concept to production—I rediscovered my interest in tech while working with CLO 3D, a powerful tool for the fashion industry that combines logical processes with creative precision. That experience reignited my fascination for software development.

Since August, I have been learning Python at Masterschool, diving from the basics into topics like coding standards and exception handling. My long-term goal is to specialize in Full-Stack Web Development, where I can combine structured logic, visual thinking, and problem-solving.
